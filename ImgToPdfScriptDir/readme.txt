Place the images you transfer from your phone from the Iscanner app, with this script as well, in any folder you like.

Place the images you transfer from your phone, with this script as well, in any folder you like.

Run the script ./ImgToPdfScript2.

This will convert all the images in order into a pdf file.

The script will ask you if there are any flipped images (you took the photos at a different orientation),
if yes you can specify which pages (should already be labelled 1-n) to "unflip them".

The script will then ask you for the name of the pdf.
